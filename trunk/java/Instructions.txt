How to Setup & Run

	Download
		The New HRTF Database and place within the 3d-sound-localization/java folder.

	Compile all java files
		javac *.java

	Run the Run program
		java Run stereo_sound.wav x y z out.wav

		Where x, y, and z are vectors for left-right, front-back, and up-down respectively.


Class Info

	Run Class
		A class that is used to convolve a single audio sample given an x, y, and z vector

	Create_Customization_Files
		A class that is used to create 4 convolve samples per subject of an audio sample. These samples are at the same elevation
		but starting at 45 degrees and going 90 degrees for every sample. (45, 135, 225, 315) They are written out to a directory
		called customization.

	Convolution Class
		Contains methods such as,

		convolveFFT - convolve signal using FFT method
		convolveSum - convolve signal using the direct sum method or definition

	Interpolation Class
		A class used to, given set of 3 vectors, finds the closest hrtfs and merges them together. Then returns the output.

	Signal Class
		Used to handle read/writing wav files as well as loading buffer data into a wav file

		loadWav - load buffer data into a wav file
		writeWav - write buffer data out into new wav file

	CipicDownloader Class
		Originally used to download the txt files from the CIPIC hrtf database. Then it was to be used to download them
		and convert them into .wav files, but it was found the WavFile class could not read files it had written. (What?)
