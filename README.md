# 3d-sound-localization

This was a senior year project I worked on with a few friends. The goal was to make stero sounds seem as if
they had a direction. We ended up incorporating the code into a Second Life clone and demoed it successfully.

I have no idea if this still works. I am hoping to find some time to try it out and get it in good shape.
